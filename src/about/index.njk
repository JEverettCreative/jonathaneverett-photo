      <p>I'm a Nashville-based creative who lives on both sides of the camera. As a photographer, I specialize in physique photography, professional headshots, and creative portraiture. As a filmmaker and actor, I bring a cinematic eye and a performer's understanding of what it means to be in front of a lens.</p>

      <p>What sets my work apart — especially in physique photography — is that I'm a competitive bodybuilder myself. I don't just photograph physiques; I understand them. I know what it takes to prep for a show, I understand the nuances of posing, and I know how to use light to highlight the conditioning, symmetry, and detail that competitors work so hard to achieve.</p>

      <p>For actors and models, I bring a director's eye to headshot sessions. I understand the casting process, the importance of range, and how a single image can open doors. My approach is collaborative and relaxed — I want you to look like yourself, not a posed version of yourself.</p>

      <p>For creative and cosplay work, I'm all in. I love building worlds, crafting dramatic lighting setups, and pushing the boundaries of what a portrait can be. Some of my favorite sessions are the ones where we throw the rulebook out and just create.</p>

      <p>When I'm not behind a camera, you'll find me in the gym, on a film set, or exploring Nashville's creative community. I believe that the best creative work comes from people who live interesting lives — and I try to live one.</p>

      <p>Let's make something together.</p>
